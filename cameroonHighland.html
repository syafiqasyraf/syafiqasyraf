    <p>Cameron Highlands in Pahang is one of Malaysia's most popular tourist destinations, a collection of peaceful townships perched 1500 meters high on a nest of serene mountains. Cooling resorts, tea plantations and strawberry farms sprawl lazily across lush valleys and meandering hillslopes, the perfect setting for a relaxing holiday.

            The sea of tranquility, pleasant landscapes and cold climate impart a special experience upon the multitudes of visitors each year. Meanwhile, a different world lies hidden away among the natural surroundings - a rainforest ecosystem rich with the wonders of nature, long held with fascination by researchers and naturalists across the world.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Cameron Highlands was discovered in 1885 by English surveyor William Cameron, under a commission by the colonial government. Forging a path through dense vegetation, he reached a magnificent and sublime plateau â€˜shut up in the mountains' along the vast Titiwangsa Range. Yet, the place lay unperturbed for 40 years, until British Administrator Sir George Maxwell developed it as a hill station.</p>
<h2> Travel Information</h2>
<p>Tourists in Cameron Highlands can expect a peaceful community with a laid back outlook of life. There are plenty of facilities and amenities expected of a modern town, including banks, clinics, restaurants, even a shopping mall (Cameron Square). Walking around is mostly safe at day or night, but you should always keep your valuables in a safe place and not leave them lying around.</p>
